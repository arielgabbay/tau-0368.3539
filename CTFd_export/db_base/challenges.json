{"count":13,"results":[{"id":1,"name":"Introduction","description":"In this challenge, a server is listening on the address/port given. You are given the server's public RSA key and an RSA encryption of the flag. When connecting to the server, it waits for a message with an RSA encryption using its public key, and when it receives such a message, it decrypts it and sends a response that indicates whether or not the plaintext is greater than N/2, where N is the public modulus.\r\nYou are also given a script that can communicate with the server and a document with more details on the oracle provided by the server and the possibilities for decrypting the given ciphertext using it. Another script that can help you test the attack script is provided; run it from the directory where your attack script is located.\r\nFinish implementing the attack on the server in the script and submit the flag!\r\nNotice that you need the \"Crypto\" module installed for Python; you can install it by running `pip install pycryptodome==3.15.0`.","max_attempts":0,"value":500,"category":"Introduction","type":"cookie","state":"visible","requirements":null,"connection_info":"Port: 5798","next_id":null},{"id":2,"name":"Challenge 01","description":"A TLS server is listening for connections on the given address/port.
