TODO list
Stage 1:
(DONE) implement basic Oracles
(DONE) implement Bleichenbacher attack for basic oracles (i.e a solution to stage1)
implement Magner attack for basic oracles (i.e a solution to stage1)
add HARD difficulty file (just an empty file so its easy)
add NORMAL difficulty file (copy from HW all the "?")
add EASY difficulty file (not yet determined)

Stage 2:
(I think its done not sure) add copy of decryption function with exceptions for Bleichenbacher 
add copy of decryption function with exceptions for Magner
add copys of decryption function with waits added in the spots for Bleichenbacher:
for large constant time.
for large random time.
for small random time.
add copys of decryption function with waits added in the spots for Manger:
for large constant time.
for large random time.
for small random time.
add Oracles_2.py file with the skeletons required for implementation of all 8 oracles (2 basic exception based and 6 timing based)
(If we find more primitves we will add the needed tasks to do theme here)

(optional) lattice based implementation of magner with limited sequential querries
